* When using hamburguer menu on smaller screens the toggle menu would scroll with the page and disappear from the screen. To fix the issue the position fixed was added to the toggle menu.

* On bigger screens the footer would appear in the middle of the screen, in order to solve the problem, the media query was added to stick the the footer at the bottom of the page.

* In the Gallery page there were gaps between the images, because not all of them were the same size. This was solved by adding media query so that the images would adapt to the size of the screen.
